# Weather_Forecast_LSTM
A neural network to predict the weather!
Using weather data from 2009 - 2016, I built & tested a Long Short-Term Memory neural network using the Tensorflow API and Keras. The model forecasts
the next days weather by looking at the previous five days.

Output & code in my [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/hismith142/Weather_Forecast_LSTM/blob/main/Weather_Forecast_LSTM.ipynb)
